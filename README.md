OAuth-1.0
=========

OAuth 1.0 using ColdFusion is a simply project for authenticating against your favorite API using the OAuth 1.0a specification.

The components are all written in script syntax, so ColdFusion 9 is required to run it.

You can read my [initial blog article](http://brianflove.com/2014/08/19/simple-oauth-1-0-using-coldfusion/) that explains how to use it.
